CMPS 11 - Assignment 1
Problem 1 - Converter (30 points)
  Write a program that helps with converting temperature measured in Fahrenheit or Kelvin to
Celsius degree. 
  Problem 2 - Ordered (35 points)
  Write a program that reads in three integers from console, x, y, and z. Then, define
a boolean variable whose value is true if the three values are either in strictly ascending order
(x < y < z) or in strictly descending order (x > y > z), and false otherwise. Your output is the
printed boolean variable.
Problem 3 - Bits (35 points)
  Write a program that takes an integer from console, N, and uses a while loop to compute the
number of times you need to divide N by 2 until it is strictly less than 1. 


CMPS 11 - Assignment 2
  Problem 1 - Series (25 points)
  Write a program that asks user to input two integers. The first integer is the power ,
and the second is a (positive) number of terms, say . Then calculate the approximation for
by evaluating the first terms of the above series.
  Problem 2 - Matrix (40 points)
Write a program that receives “m” and “n” as the number of rows and columns of a
matrix, respectively. Then it follows by “m” lines of input from the user, each referring to “n”
integers in each row of the matrix.
The program then continuously reads commands from user and performs different
operations based on user’s command. User’s command will be one of the following:
  ❖ T: Transpose - rows become columns (and vice versa) and prints the result matrix.
  ❖ R: RowMultiply - multiplies all values in each of the rows and prints the results in
one line, separated by space.
  ❖ C: ColumnMin - finds the smallest value in each of the columns and prints the
results in one line, separated by space.
  ❖ Q: Quit - stops reading commands from the user.
  Problem 3 - Words (35 points)
We want to find out how many words in our list of words do not have any repeated
characters. 
  ❖ Input: An integer ’n’ indicating the number of words in our list. Then, it follows
with ’n’ words/strings, each in one line.
  ❖ Output: An integer representing the number of words in our list without any
repeated characters.


CMPS 11 - Assignment 3
  Bingo.java (60 points)
We want to write a Java program to simulate a bingo game. Players use cards that
feature five columns of five cells each, with every cell containing a number between 1 to 90.
In each step of the game a number between 1 and 90 is called randomly and players need to
mark the number in their card if they have it. The first player who marks all of the numbers
in one row of one of his/her cards is the winner of the game. 
  Path.java (40 points)
In this question we want to implement a class to simulate a 2D path composed of
multiple 2D points.
